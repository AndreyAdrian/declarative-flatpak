>>- CONSIDERING, BUT NOT PLANNED -<<

[ ] use a fetcher, allowing us to move the flatpak itself into the store

[ ] opt-in telemetry for "stable" branch
[ ] opt-out telemetry for "dev" branch
--> requires branch detection code

==> PLANNED <==

<-> WORKING ON IT <->

[ ] Deduplicate files

<|| DONE ||>

[X] out-of-tree flatpaks
[X] consider the remote when diffing the installed packages
--> fix bug with diffing when different branches are used
[X] use Nix more
[X] update docs with new definitions
[X] overrides
[X] support for installing a specific commit of a ref
[X] Separate by boot
[X] Keep the flatpak install from previous boot, but clean old ones
[X] Add a safety precaution in case the bootid changes, but the module didn't complete the update (and then GCs the only valid installation)
--> PREVENT THE ACTIVE GEN FROM BEING GC'D AT ALL COSTS UNTIL REBOOT
